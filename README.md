Code for FruitBasket

The fruit names are an enumeration of names of the possible fruits that are available.
The fruit class takes one of those enumerations and a cost to be associated with that fruit.
The basket class contains a list that can contain any number of fruit objects and can
calculate the cost of all fruits in the basket with calculateCost().

Several tests were created to test the functionalities of being able to create fruits and add them to the basket
as well as being able to calculate the proper costs of the fruits put into the basket.
